# Auto Matched Pairs

Copy of [another one of my repos](https://github.com/lee-guiberson/Stats) with a README added. I had to create this one since the other one is an archive, and I'm unable to edit it anymore.

A simple web server that automates the process of creating a matched pairs design. Accessing the website's url, redirects the participants at random to one form or another, forming roughly two groups of equal size.
